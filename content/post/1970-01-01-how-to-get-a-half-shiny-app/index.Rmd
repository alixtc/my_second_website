Do you want a half-shiny App ? Because that's how you get a nice half-shiny app with half of your screen being grey like that : 

![](half-shiny.png)

For that I just had to split my UI and Server functions the wrong way. Instead off having an "app.R" in your application folder:

Besides the lame jokes, it took me ages to figure out what was actually going around. Turns out I was just following bad practices for splitting my app. What I did wrong was:

- Created a ui.R file with obviously the UI...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
  # Put Here all your nice code  
)
# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

- Created a server.R file with... the server function
```{r eval=FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Here again anything working
}
```

- Ran the app and witness half of your magnificent app turn magically into a grey screen.



# HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM?
- you KEEP an app.R file in your application folder, with only these lines of code

```{r}
library(shiny)
source(file = "ui.R")
source(file= "server.R")
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


- In the UI file ("ui.R"), you modify the origal code using `shinyUI()`, like that:
```{r}
ui <- shinyUI({fluidPage(
  # ALL the nice code you can imagine
)})
```
- your server.R file does not change

Now the half-grey screen at the bottom of your app should be gone. You can't imagine how much time I spent working on this using poor fixes like fixed app height that I needed to adjust perpetually depending on the changes.
