```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Theming with bslib can be a bit difficult to apprehend for those like me that never set foot in the world of HTML and CSS. By trial and error I found a few options that are worth mentioning for modifying a Navbar.

- option `inverse` in navbarPage, setting it to TRUE fill the navbar 

- options that work inside `bs_theme()` for theme "simplex" and "united":
```{r eval=FALSE}
bs_them(                                      
  `navbar-dark-brand-color` = "#D9230F", #working
  "navbar-dark-color" = "lightblue", ## working
  `navbar-dark-hover-color` = "black" #working
)
```

Code that does not work so far inside bs_theme
```{r eval=FALSE}

# 'navbar-bg' = "black",
# 'navbar-light-color' = "black",
# `navbar-dark-bg` = "purple",
# `navbar-dark-contrast` = "black",

```
