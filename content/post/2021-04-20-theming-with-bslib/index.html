<p>Theming with bslib can be a bit difficult to apprehend for those like me that never set foot in the world of HTML and CSS. By trial and error I found a few options that are worth mentioning for modifying a Navbar.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>option <code>inverse</code> in navbarPage, setting it to TRUE fill the navbar</p></li>
<li><p>options that work inside <code>bs_theme()</code> for theme “simplex” and “united”:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>bs_them(                                      
  `navbar-dark-brand-color` = &quot;#D9230F&quot;, #working
  &quot;navbar-dark-color&quot; = &quot;lightblue&quot;, ## working
  `navbar-dark-hover-color` = &quot;black&quot; #working
)</code></pre>
<p>Code that does not work so far inside bs_theme</p>
<pre class="r"><code># &#39;navbar-bg&#39; = &quot;black&quot;,
# &#39;navbar-light-color&#39; = &quot;black&quot;,
# `navbar-dark-bg` = &quot;purple&quot;,
# `navbar-dark-contrast` = &quot;black&quot;,</code></pre>
